# Week 4 - Agile Development and Software Testing  

## Tasks Overview  
This week focuses on developing a simple To-Do List application while applying Agile methodologies and Test-Driven Development (TDD).  

### Tasks  
1. **To-Do List Application**  
   - Design and develop a To-Do List application that allows users to:  
     - Add tasks.  
     - Mark tasks as complete.  
     - Delete tasks.  
   - Follow Agile practices by creating a product backlog and sprint backlog.  

2. **Design Backlog in Figma**  
   - Use Figma to design a product backlog that includes user stories and acceptance criteria:  
     - *As a user, I want to add tasks so that I can keep track of what I need to do.*  
     - *As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete to indicate they have been done.*  
     - *As a user, I want to delete tasks to remove them from my list.*  

3. **Sprint Backlog in Trello**  
   - Create a sprint backlog in Trello with tickets for:  
     - Designing the user interface.  
     - Implementing task addition, completion, and deletion features.  
     - Writing tests for each feature.  

4. **Apply Testing Techniques**  
   - Follow TDD by writing tests before implementation.  
   - Apply testing techniques such as:  
     - **Boundary Testing:** Validate task length.  
     - **Equivalence Partitioning:** Test valid/invalid inputs.  
     - **State Transition Testing:** Define task states (active, completed) and transitions.  

5. **Document Testing Process**  
   - Document the testing process, detailing techniques used and test cases generated.  

### Deliverables  
- To-Do List application source code.  
- Product backlog in Figma.  
- Sprint backlog in Trello.  
- Testing documentation with details of techniques and test cases.
